# Community

## How to Get Involved

Join the SkyMusic community on our Discord server. Participate in discussions, get support, and share your ideas directly with me, the developer. It’s a great way to connect and contribute to the project, and your feedback is invaluable as I continue to develop and improve SkyMusic.

## Community Engagement

The Discord channel serves as the central hub for all community interactions. You will find channels dedicated to support, development discussions, and feature suggestions. As the sole developer, I’m active on the server, and engaging with the community is one of the best ways to stay informed and involved in the ongoing development of SkyMusic.
