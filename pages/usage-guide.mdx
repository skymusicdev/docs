## Common Issues and Their Solutions

In this section, we address some of the common issues you might encounter while using our app, along with their solutions. Understanding these problems and knowing how to resolve them can enhance your overall experience and help you make the most out of our features.

### Project Issues

### Account Issues

Due to the decentralized nature of our app, only the user has access to their own profile. We use a seed-based solution for this purpose.

Please ensure you store your seed phrase in a secure location to maintain access to your profile.
